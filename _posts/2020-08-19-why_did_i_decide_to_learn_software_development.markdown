I've worked in many fields since I was 16 starting at a restaurant working for a grocery store fitness section while going to school and eventually becoming an EMT for a short time before becoming a part business owner in a parkour gym for a few years before selling off my shares and now working as a civil drafter for an engineering firm. all of these jobs lead me to great things and places however they always had one thing in common. I worked so many hours to pay just enough to get by and moved a lot to accommodate my work. the last move the hardest as me and my girlfriend have now gone to long distance so we can both work in our respective field with the lack of work being so readily available we had to make the best financial choice to set up for our future.

after looking into all the ways to get into coding as it was something that interested me in the past but without the time to really devote to getting the best from any programs. My girlfriend with her experience working in the marketing field and all the software engineers she has worked hand and hand with made me realize. I should carve out the time to make the change in my career so that I could really focus on doing something I enjoy and move back home to Colorado. 
With the way the world is now with most fields going as remote as possible my options in finding a career that I can make the money to move back home. Has made my interest in learning all that this program has to offer so appealing. 
We are both people who enjoy the great outdoors and travel is so big that working in a field that has the big bonus of having lots of remote work opportunities is extremely appealing 
It is also something that I've found through the pre Bootcamp prep work that I've enjoyed  the challenge and struggle of getting my code to work 
I'm excited to continue learning and really dive in
