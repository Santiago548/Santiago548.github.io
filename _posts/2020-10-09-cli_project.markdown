Took me a while to get started. With lots of reading/re-reading and watching videos anytime I could at work when on lunch or at break. It started smooth, but I hit some roadblocks with accidently setting up the git repo incorrectly and had to redo things more than a handfull of times. 

I kept going along until i had a 'working' program that used the API I chose correctly. but when it came to refactoring to make everything DRY and make sure I wasnt creating multiple objects with the same information I got stuck for a long while.

but after many long nights after a quick metting and the keen eye from my instructor Charlotte. I found where I had made my simple error fixed it and refactored my code to not only work even better and instantiate a single object and find that object. I was able to give that object much more information and had a more built out output I could give the user.
