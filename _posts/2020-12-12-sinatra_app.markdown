Second project, more hurdles and struggles. With those hurdles and struggles lots of growth and understanding. biggest issue for me was getting my images to format correctly to look good with the site. but very happy that I was able to get it to work exactly how I imagined it. Every character has a class which has its own image and using a case statment they are associated to the correct character. After submitting and getting reviewed to hopefully pass the assement. I will continue to add functionallity and fully flesh out this APP. Found a lot of real drive to continue to work on this. compared to the CLI the revil in figuring out what was wrong was so much higher and getting it to work exactyl how i wanted.
