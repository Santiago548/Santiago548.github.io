I started this project trying to wrap my head around how I wanted it to work. and through lots of trial and error slimmed it down to be exactly what I wanted. lots of googleing went into getting to work just right. surprisingly the omniauth was the simpleist part of this project. Where I found difficultiy was getting my associations to work exactly how I wanted them to work within the peramiters provided. 

As always our cohort lead was extremlly helpful in finding something i overlooked. again showing the invaluability in getting a second pair of eyes when coding.

I think with this one I will keep working on it to make it something I can acutually use for my D&D campaigns to help myself and my quest mates keep better track of all our information in one easy place.
