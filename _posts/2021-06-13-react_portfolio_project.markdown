After what seems like a long time I've finally made it to the final project requirement for my class. taking everything I've learned up to this point to create an application that I am proud of. going from knowing nothing to feeling like I've stuffed my brain with a building of knowledge and knowing I have so much more that I can learn.

## The Project
My project is a small character generator the main focus was making a generator for people who have trouble starting a character for their tabletop RPG when they need to make someone up on the fly or can also double as practice for writing more in-depth characters. 

The generator provides basic info like name, age, gender, and region they are from. it also provides two character traits with a background and story hook to start the wheels turning to what the story for the character could be.

this has been pretty similar to a lot of my other projects. mostly focused on creating characters for Dungeons and Dragons.  first starting with just retrieving info from an API in my CLI project. After that writing a Character creator that had users creating characters for their D&D campaigns.  Then taking those things to create an application that combined those things to allow for multiple users to create a party to keep track of their games together. finally making a random generator for NPC characters for a campaign that would populate information for random NPCs and enemies for the campaign. 

D&D is fantasy based i.e. Dragons, goblins, and magic. I wanted to branch out and make an application that isn't as focused on the high fantasy roleplay but could be more general for writing different stories in different settings. Tabletop roleplay is just collective storytelling and a lot of that storytelling is set on the Game Master and sometimes it's a bit tricky to come up with something on the fly. 

So with this application, I made it so that a user could come up with a character on the spot with the click of a button for multiple Tabletop RPG games.

### Challanges

the biggest challenge for this project was making sure everything was set up correctly to just work. there was a lot of prep work to get it all moving and grooving as I wanted it to, but when it was all barebones working and I had gone through and fixed all my misspellings and bugs I was beyond happy to see my vision working. 

The debugger is key let's just say thank you to our instructor Charlotte for instilling in us to drop a pry or debugger as much as we can and really really learn how to get those things to work. The debugger in this was my biggest friend. it really helped me figure out exactly how things were breaking and what data I was passing around, and how to access the correct information for my components to render. it helped me to really understand how state works and how I was passing it from my containers and components.

my other big challenge was really wanting to get more comfortable with CSS. I think with this project I got so much more comfortable in understanding how to style with CSS and getting my application looking exactly how I wanted it to look.

### After Thoughts

Similar to my projects from before I am already seeing ways that I could have done it better or make it more versatile. or even add some more functionality to it to make it so much more robust in what it can do. I am excited as this being the last project for my time in this fantastic course to go back and make those changes and take what I've learned from these projects to make my older projects even better.

I'm astonished that I've come so far in this time during the course. I've learned so much and can't believe the amount of knowledge I've been able to obtain going from feeling so overwhelmed in my first CLI project to be able to develop some amazing applications in Ruby, Javascript, and now React. I'm eternally grateful to everyone who has helped me get to the point that I am now getting towards the end of this course.

I can't wait to take all the things I've learned so far and continue to build on the strong foundations I've created thanks to Flatirons intuitive curriculum and my amazing instructor Charlotte
