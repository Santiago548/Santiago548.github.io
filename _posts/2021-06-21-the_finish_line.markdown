It's the 21st I've officially completed the whole curriculum and received my final portfolio project review. I've come to the end of my Flatiron journey. It will feel odd not meeting every week for a new lesson or having some lab to work on. 

My biggest takeaway out of all the things I learned was the drive to continue to learn. All these ideas bouncing around in my head now have a place to go. I've gotten the capability now to build out these things. The capability to find how to do things on my own to take those ideas in my head and build them out.

I'm ready to get on the job hunt now and see where I land. I'm also ready to go back and improve upon my past projects with all the information I've learned now and make them more robust and add some features I wanted to add but couldn't before due to time constraints.

Finally, I want to thank Our Instructor Charollete. Without her getting through this would have been impossible. Her ability to take these complicated concepts and translate them into a way that someone who hasn't done any coding before was amazing. She also was consistent in reaching out and helping to make sure we succeeded through pushing our critical thinking and making sure the knowledge we needed was being fully understood. for that Im super grateful to her!

Today I take my first steps towards a career in coding wherever that may be, but I started here at Flatirons and the foundations I learned will permeate into everything I do from here on out.
